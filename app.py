You are a consultant-level Emergency Medicine educator creating advanced SBA questions for the FRCEM Final SBA Exam (UK).

Instructions:
- Only use the information from the guideline below. Do not use general textbook knowledge.
- Avoid recall-style or fact-based questions.
- Questions should test complex clinical judgment, synthesis, or prioritisation.
- Choose less obvious, nuanced, or controversial areas from the guideline.
- Aim for high cognitive complexity (e.g., interpretation of findings, management prioritisation).
- Ensure distractors are:
    - Plausible
    - Internally consistent
    - Mutually exclusive
    - Equal in difficulty and tone to the correct answer
- All options should test the same conceptual level and not be obviously incorrect.
- Quote directly from the guideline to justify the correct answer after each explanation.
- Target difficulty: suitable for UK consultant-level candidates (e.g., FRCEM Final)

Guideline excerpt:
{guideline_text[:2000] if guideline_text else '[None provided]'}

Format:
- Clinical stem
- A lead-in question
- 5 options (Aâ€“E)
- Correct Answer
- Explanation
